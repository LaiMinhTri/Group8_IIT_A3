                        The Game Designer (GD) would be responsible for creating the gameâ€™s environment, assets,
                        character models, gameplay system, and user experience of our game. He/she would ensure that the
                        mood, look, and feel of the game align with our initial ideas. The GD needs to work closely with
                        the Game Developer to code and load all of his/her design into a finished product.
