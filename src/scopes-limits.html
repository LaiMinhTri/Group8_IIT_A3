                        Due to the time limits, our group has to redefine the scope and reduce the number of characters,
                        interactions, industries, jobs, and tasks to create the finished product on time. Instead of
                        making high-quality 3D games, we will stick to the basics of 2D games with simple but attractive
                        designs and interactions.

                    The time limit and lack of skills allow our team to design one character and a basic background.
                    The landing page will include a login account that allows the players to save their unfinished
                    tasks. After logging in, players will enter the software engineer room and they can choose
                    whether to study Python and take a quiz or to find the errors in the report.

                    <!-- Interaction -->
                    <p>
                    <h3 style="color: #81B29A;"><b>Interaction:</b></h3>
                    "A game needs to provide interaction for a player to truly have agency" (Fristoe, 2016). As Fristoe
                    mentioned, there are 3 types of interaction: game-player interaction, game-game interaction, and
                    player-player interaction. Our group can only generate the game-player interaction, such as the
                    character’s movements and the game’s reaction to the player’s choices. We also create a non-player
                    character (NPC) to assign the Python tasks and give instructions to players.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Music -->
                    <p>
                    <h3 style="color: #81B29A;"><b>Music:</b></h3>
                    Music is also an important element in attracting players. The music and soundtrack of this game will
                    be soft and melodious, helping players relax and concentrate on doing the tasks. For the quiz, there
                    will be an incorrect sound effect when the players choose the wrong answers, and the correct sound
                    if they answer correctly.
                    </p>

                    <h3 style="color: #81B29A;"><b>Mockup:</b></h3>
                    The simple Python-syntax quiz is created for use as a reference. This would also be the same quiz
                    used in the final version of the game to not only introduce the player to the type of programming
                    language they need to learn for the job, but also whether the Software engineering position is a
                    good fit for them or not. This mockup was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

                        There are many features and functions that our group cannot complete in 4 weeks:
                    </p>

                    <!-- Character and Background designs: -->
                    <p>
                    <h3 style="color: #81B29A;"><b>Character and Background designs:</b></h3>
                    The initial idea is to make the game with various working industries such as Business (Tourism and
                    Hospitality, Marketing, Logistics and Finance), Art and Design (Account, Designer, Film Director,
                    and Fashion Designer), and IT (Data Analyst, Cloud Architect, AI Developer and Mobile Developer).
                    Each job tower will have different tasks based on the work characteristics. The broad scope of
                    functions and features cannot be completed in 4 weeks since our team needs to do research and have a
                    deep insight into each career.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Interaction -->
                    <p>
                    <h3 style="color: #81B29A;"><b>Interaction:</b></h3>
                    There will be more interactions between players and players like adding friends, sending messages
                    and doing tasks together in this game. Additionally, more NPCs in different towers will provide
                    instructions and give tasks for players.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Game Logo -->
                    <p>
                    <h3 style="color: #81B29A;"><b>Game Logo:</b></h3>
                    The game logo should be designed at the very last stage when all the basic features and functions of
                    the game are done. The meaningful and memorable logo will attract players and stick in their heads
                    for a long time so that it takes time to design the game logo.
