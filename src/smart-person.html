                        Since the purpose of this game is to give the young generation a deeper understanding about
                        different careers, we need to employ somebody that has experience in many working fields,
                        especially Art and Design, IT and Business industries. This person will integrate his rich and
                        varied experience of life into the game story to educate the youngster. He/she will also take
                        charge in creating tasks and giving solutions to the problems. This position is crucial to our
                        project because if we generate the wrong knowledge about jobs, it will reduce our image and
                        reputation. Besides that, an individual who has an impressively in-depth knowledge can help our
                        team to develop the game if we want to expand more industries in the future. Because this is an
                        educational game, it will save a lot of time and resources if our team has a worldly-wise
                        person.
