                        In this project, we are creating a career exploration game that helps Vietnamese high school
                        students to be better informed on which career path they should choose when entering university.
                        As such, the game will feature a variety of roles in a wide range of industries e.g. IT,
                        communication, finance, business, etc.

                        To begin testing, we must ensure that our code is functional and behaves appropriately. To do
                        this, we will play the game and debug any issues that arise; after the technical portion is
                        complete, we will move on to the social portion. We envision that our project will result in a
                        game that inspires and guides people to pursue careers that are a good fit for them, and because
                        this game requires a great deal of information to be completed, we recognize that we will need
                        to solicit feedback from a large number of people in order to have test results for each
                        personality type. Our method of testing the project is to promote it on social media, at our
                        university, in class, and to urge people to give it a try. After accumulating sufficient data,
                        we will attempt to develop our game and round out the final product.

                        us, we never experienced coding before nor making a game. We have been learning to do anything
                        from scratch, but there are a limited number of things we can learn in a short period of time
                        and after 3 months of studying in this course we cannot say that the project outcome of
                        assignment 3 is perfect but we surely can say that we are proud of it...

                        As a result of our team's bonding since the start of assignment 2, we have gained sufficient
                        knowledge of one another's strengths and weaknesses to more efficiently distribute work and
                        ensure that everyone is doing what they do best, while also avoiding communication breakdowns.
                        Due to the project's size, we have divided the work among ourselves and then meet in person once
                        a week to ensure that our workload is manageable and that we are progressing as quickly as
                        possible through the use of our collective knowledge. Our group also meets every Saturday night
                        at 8 p.m in which we communicate via messenger's call to discuss what we did over the weekend
                        and what we will do next, as well as any issues that may arise while working on the assignment.
                        In the meeting, we use google docs to write down what we have discussed and what we have done.
                        So that we can later review it or for any member who cannot attend the meeting can read it and
                        know what we have discussed and know what to do next.
