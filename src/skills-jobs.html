                        To accomplish the goal of creating a fully playable game, this project will require the
                        assistance of a game developer. We will be looking for someone with prior experience with
                        Gamemaker studio 2 and the Gamemaker language, as this is the game engine our team chose and has
                        been working with for several weeks, as well as strong communication and collaboration skills...

                        The Game Designer (GD) would be responsible for creating the gameâ€™s environment, assets,
                        character models, gameplay system, and user experience of our game. He/she would ensure that the
                        mood, look, and feel of the game align with our initial ideas. The GD needs to work closely with
                        the Game Developer to code and load all of his/her design into a finished product...

                        Almost every project requires the hiring of a marketing or sales professional. The success of a
                        project is contingent upon public awareness and participation, as well as the provision of
                        constructive feedback on the project's progress. Additionally, we need to promote our game to
                        ensure that businesses are aware of our existence and, hopefully, willing to contribute to the
                        funding of our project...
