                        Never has the phrase “Our past experiences shape who we are” been more evident when we analyze
                        each member’s career plan. Whereas Thu and My’s love for all-thing-data is reflected through
                        their career choices, namely Senior Data Analyst at Google and Data Engineer at Pops Worldwide
                        respectively, Tri aspired for a managerial role as an IT Project Manager at Titan Technology,
                        and finally Vu aimed to be a Business System Analyst at BHC Canada Inc.

                    <p>
                        As a data engineer, My would have to manipulate data for later use and optimize Pops Worldwide’s
                        infrastructure to improve scalability and performance. She would also be expected to work well
                        with the development and management team to then analyze those data to gain valuable insights
                        that would help the businesses in its future ventures and marketing campaigns. As the role
                        requires foundational knowledge of Data management systems tools e.g. Mongo, MySQL, and
                        PostgreSQL alongside the Python programming language, My planned to acquaint herself with the
                        three databases management tools within 2022, followed by two personal ML (Machine Learning)
                        projects: Handwriting Recognition using Deep Learning and PDF to Word Converter to brush up her
                        resume further.

                    <p>
                        For Thu’s position, she would be able to work across departments to protect Google’s reputation
                        against spam, fraud, and abuse, all the while improving the experiences of the company’s users
                        and partners as well as ensuring their safety. The prospect of working for one of the biggest
                        names in IT, to meet and work with people from different backgrounds, and overall, to be able to
                        grow her career in Singapore, one of the best countries in terms of technological expertise (US
                        News Staff 2021), excited her. Hence, she planned to familiarize herself with the R programming
                        language, MATLAB, and Microsoft Excel during her time at RMIT, and intern as a data analyst
                        after her study to build the foundation she needed to apply for the job.

                        Being a Project Manager comes with great responsibility, but also greater rewards. And that is
                        what has gotten Tri into this specific role. As a PM, he is expected to manage and lead teams of
                        highly-skilled individuals, who may or may not always agree with how things are carried out.
                        Thus, when conflicts arise, Tri would be the first person people come to to quell any further
                        clashes, mediate, and put everyone on the same page. To achieve his goal, Tri planned to first
                        obtain a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University Vietnam, and then start working
                        in entry-level roles such as software developer or data analyst to build up his credentials.

                        And lastly, Vu. His chosen career path was the least programming-intensive out of the bunch and
                        leaned more towards client management. As a Business System Analyst, Vu is responsible for
                        delivering projects and initiatives involving business processes, business change and technology
                        solutions. He would be seen consulting with either internal or external stakeholders (if working
                        in a consulting firm) to determine requirements, develop business cases, oversee the
                        implementation of systems, and work closely with technical team members. The entire process is
                        similar to that of an advertising agency, of which Vu had experiences working in; hence his
                        liking towards the role.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To prepare for this position, Vu would undertake a 2-year IT diploma program at the Northern
                        Institute of Technology (NAIT) in Alberta, Canada to gain sufficient knowledge, and then apply
                        for work after graduation to obtain experience. After around two years, he would come back to
                        NAIT and transfer his credit towards the school’s Bachelor of Technology (BTech) program. This
                        way, not only would he have the much-needed working experiences, but also the required
                        Bachelor’s degree for the job.
