                        The initial purpose of developing this game is to give the younger generation an overview of
                        different working fields and a general day for a specific job. Even though there are many
                        sources about high-paying jobs or the best careers in demand for the future, some youngsters
                        still struggle when registering for the college entrance exam. There are 40–50% of Vietnamese
                        students whose jobs are unrelated to their majors (Ha Anh 2020). The reason for this trend could
                        be that they do not have the opportunity to experience different working areas, which leads to
                        many consequences, such as time-consuming and money-wasting for the learners when choosing a
                        major randomly. We hope that by incorporating these ideas into our game, the players will
                        understand what they want and choose the right career path while immersing themselves in the
                        chilling atmosphere of the game. However, with the limit of time and lack of human resources, we
                        can only focus on the IT industry and software engineers, to be more specific. The finished game
                        will bring the player to a day working as a software engineer and allow them to do some basic
                        tasks for beginners. This game will enhance the players’ experience with the elegantly
                        simplistic design and soft music, as well as give people an overview of the software engineer
                        job.

                        As mentioned, there is a time limit and a lack of human resources, so the game has 2 main goals.
                        Programming and writing reports are the basic tasks that every software engineer needs to know.
                        If there is more time and resources, we will add more tasks and working industries to help
                        players have a clear insight into different careers.

                            <b style="color: #E07A5F;"> Study one of the most popular languages, Python: </b>According to javinpaul, Python is
                            one of the top 5 programming languages for software engineers (javinpaul 2020). In order to
                            help users understand this language and have a basic foundation in coding, the game will
                            recommend to users some external links about Python, such as w3schools and freeCodeCamp.
                            After self-study time, the game will give players some basic quizzes. You have to choose one
                            of four options. The questions will be gathered from different sources, and there is no time
                            limit for taking the quiz. This part is to help users get used to programming as well as
                            deeply understand Python's functions and syntax.

                            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Examine reports for errors:</b> According to Audrey, besides writing and modifying codes,
                            a software engineer also writes documentation about the functionality and features of the
                            products (Webster 2020). Therefore, this game will introduce the players to basic technical
                            writing skills and require them to find the mistakes in the documentation. The issues could
                            be about grammar, misuse of vocabulary, and misunderstanding the functionality of the
                            products. The users only need to find the problems with the document; they do not have to
                            correct them because there are many ways to fix the issues. The game will show the answer
                            after the users have finished. The example documentation is collected from Apple or
                            Microsoft.
