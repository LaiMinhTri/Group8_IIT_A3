                        Almost every project requires the hiring of a marketing or sales professional. The success of a
                        project is contingent upon public awareness and participation, as well as the provision of
                        constructive feedback on the project's progress. Additionally, we need to promote our game to
                        ensure that businesses are aware of our existence and, hopefully, willing to contribute to the
                        funding of our project. We are looking for individuals who are visionary and creative in their
                        thinking, as well as individuals with prior marketing experience and knowledge, to fill this
                        position. This task is necessary because our game requires a significant amount of information
                        from the user to function properly.
