                        This assignment 3 is a complex project with multiple components that must be finished within a
                        certain time range. As a result, we must develop plans from the start, monitor their
                        implementation, and constantly evaluate their success. To begin, because assignment 3 is a
                        continuation of assignment 2, the team ensured that they had a good grasp on the project concept
                        prior to beginning work on it. We began work on this project in response to the assignment 2
                        criteria, during which we discussed the project's concept, theme, and technical requirements.
                        Then, in week 8, as we completed assignment 2, our team convened to discuss reasonable
                        expectations for assignment 3 as well as the work's format. This discussion was used to explore
                        and define the changes we would make to the app's design and functionality in order to
                        accommodate the application's constrained scope and resources.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info-text">
                        With reference to the assignment 2 theme and concepts, we have arranged multiple meetings during
                        week 8 to discuss and narrow down the most relevant options. We were unsure which direction to
                        pursue while reviewing the member's proposals because they were all realistic and had a high
                        probability of success. However, Pham Thu's idea - a career-focused online platform designed to
                        expose young Vietnamese students to a variety of departments and businesses - intrigues us. As a
                        consequence of examining the several methods for combining other members' suggestions into Thu's
                        game, we arrived at the current version of the game. When debating the notions, the participants
                        demonstrated consideration for one another's viewpoints while attempting to incorporate as many
                        distinct functions as possible.

                        As we approach the ninth week of the semester, the technical report required for Assignment 2 is
                        almost complete. This is the stage at which our team gathers following the week's Information
                        Technology instruction to begin modifying the game's level in preparation for the third
                        assignment. Due to time and budget constraints, we have confined the scope of the research to
                        one industry (the Information Technology Industry) and one specific profession (Software
                        Engineering). As part of this employment, the player will be exposed to two distinct
                        responsibilities. There are two types of tasks: those that check for grammar and those that
                        check for syntax. We've divided tasks according to this structure, with one person in charge of
                        UX/UI design and mockups and the rest of the team in responsibility of game development and
                        testing.

                        Following a thorough understanding of the game's fundamental requirements and a fundamental
                        understanding of the game, the game development team performed considerable research to find the
                        best game engine for the game. We considered a range of aspects, including the game engine's
                        difficulty level and the steepness of the learning curve. Additionally, given our game will be a
                        standard pixelated 2D game, the game engine must include a broad range of 2D game creation tools
                        and resources. Our team chose Gamemaker Studio 2 based on the breadth of tools offered and the
                        company's reputation for 2D game support. At the time, the team was generally confident in our
                        choice, despite the possibility that it might have resulted in considerable issues later in the
                        implementation phase.

                        Following our determination of each individual's primary responsibility and the project's
                        general design, our team spent substantial time learning and becoming comfortable with the
                        Gamemaker studio 2. The game developers studied and examined numerous YouTube tutorials in order
                        to understand how to program in the platform's proprietary language (GML). Additionally,
                        material such as the Little Town handbook, which can be found on the company's website, is
                        incredibly beneficial during our educational process. Similarly, the team has commenced and is
                        now concluding the technical report that was initiated during this time period. Additionally,
                        Vu, the principal designer on our team, has begun work on the group's presentation slides.

                        At the end of week 10, our team ran into an unforeseen snag: during the execution phase, our
                        team was unable to properly configure the Gamemaker Studio 2 file. The intricacy of the
                        situation prompted us to perform extensive research into the issue in order to identify a fix.
                        However, following several days of testing, rebooting, and restarting the application, we were
                        forced to drastically extend the game development deadlines due to technical challenges. By the
                        end of week 10, we had determined that any further delay would put us at risk of submitting the
                        project late, as other components needed to be completed. To validate the layout and concept of
                        the game, our team produced an interactive mockup that featured Javascript, HTML, and CSS for
                        some of the game's features and functions. As a result, we will have a functional prototype in
                        addition to a polished technical report for the record.

                    <p>
                        Additionally, the team begins focusing on meeting report writing and presentation preparation
                        deadlines at the start of week 11. Our team has scheduled an early meeting on Wednesday to
                        assign and coordinate the various components of the report's duties and responsibilities and
                        jobs section. Additionally, we ensure that all relevant content has been loaded into the slides
                        presentation and that the presenting duties have been distributed for Friday's mock presentation
                        during the training session. Due to the fact that our team was nearly finished drafting our
                        report at this point, the assigned tasks appeared to be simple and were accomplished on time.

                    <p>
                        At this point, our team has built interactive mockups of the character's distinct
                        responsibilities, as well as a detailed visual of the game's characters and levels. We also
                        spent some time investigating Gamemaker Studio 2, and notably the GML language that is utilized
                        in it, during our collaboration. Additionally, our team members have been exposed to a variety
                        of game engines, including Unity, and have developed an understanding of the engine's merits and
                        weaknesses in comparison to Gamemaker and other alternatives. Additionally, our team's
                        understanding of Javascript, HTML, and CSS was used to create the website and quiz prototype for
                        the game. As a result of our collaboration, we also developed critical soft skills such as
                        communication and teamwork, which were among the many things we took away from the experience. I
                        believe that with additional time, our team could have made more progress in using Gamemaker to
                        produce a functional game, as we had hoped from the start. Regardless of the obstacles, each
                        member of the team was incredibly devoted and persistent in bringing our dream of creating an
                        interactive career guidance platform to life.
