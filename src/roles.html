                        I was responsible for conducting research and collaborating with my teammates on the game's
                        development. Three stages comprise the game's development process: research, development, and
                        testing. Initially, My was the team leader and tasked me with conducting research in a variety
                        of industries, including business and design. During the development phase, we used GameMaker
                        Studio 2 and the GameMaker language to create an interactive game. My responsibilities included
                        designing a room where people could take an IT quiz and interacting with NPCs. Additionally, I
                        was in charge of developing the test. Additionally, as part of the testing phase, I ensure that
                        everything works as expected and plan a marketing campaign for the project in the future.

                        I was responsible for conducting research and developing the game for our project, along with
                        two of my teammates. The game's development process is divided into three stages: research,
                        development, and testing. For the first stage, My was our team leader, and she tasked me with
                        researching the information technology industry, specifically what jobs are popular right now,
                        in order to incorporate them into our game. Following the research phase, we began developing
                        the game using Gamemaker Studio 2, with me serving as project manager and leader. I always make
                        sure that my teammates are doing their best and that everything will be completed on time.
                        Additionally, I programmed the login screen, the boot room, and the transitions between these
                        rooms. Finally, in accordance with Thu's instructions, we will test the functionality of our
                        game and, if any issues arise, we will address them immediately.

                        For this assignment, I was responsible for conducting research and developing the game with my
                        other teammates. The game's development process is divided into three stages: research,
                        development, and testing. To begin, I served as team leader, delegating tasks to my teammates
                        while I experimented with various game engines in order to determine which one was the best fit.
                        We began developing the game using Gamemaker studio 2 after conducting research. Tri led our
                        team during this phase, and he tasked me with the responsibility of establishing an IT industry
                        and character movement. Additionally, I discovered some sprites to use as decorative elements in
                        the game while doing so. Finally, for the testing task, I have tested our game several times and
                        fixed all the errors while also preparing future plans for the assignment.
