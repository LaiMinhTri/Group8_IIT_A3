                        print(Name) was chosen as our team’s name as we wanted to embody the ever-popular Python
                        programming language. As an open-source, high-level programming language with extreme
                        versatility in the fields of Data Mining, Data Science, AI (Artificial Intelligence),
                        Machine learning, Web Development, Embedded System, Gaming, Testing, Automation (Desmond &
                        McKenzie 2021), and so much more, we believe Python represents the diverse background of our
                        team members. For instance, Thu originally came from the School of Business Management, and
                        Vu from the School of Communication & Design. Nevertheless, each member’s skill set
                        complements one another and we all come together to work towards a common goal - that is to
                        ace this assignment and (hopefully) turn our project into a reality.

                        My name is Vu and I am currently a final-year student at RMIT University. Originally coming from
                        the School of Communication and Design (SCD), particularly the Professional Communication
                        program, I have dedicated this last general elective of mine to explore the gng field of
                        Information Technology (IT); hence, my enrollment within the Introduction to IT itself. With the
                        current advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), it is safe to
                        assume that in the near future, AI and automation would come for my bread and butter as a
                        communicator. For instance, Vox (2017) highlighted how automation was used to edit a news video
                        from scratch (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJKjMIU55pE&t=39s" style="color: #F2CC8F;" target="_blank">video</a>), or how the rapid development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) enabled
                        software to “write” virtually coherent bodies of texts (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcHkxP9adiM" style="color: #F2CC8F;" target="_blank">video</a>). Thus, by taking this course, I
                        am hoping to get an overview of the IT field as a whole to better inform my decision to change
                        my career path in the future.

                        Hi! My name is Pham Anh Thu and my student number is s3878246. I was born and raised in Ho Chi
                        Minh City despite that both of my parents come from the North of Vietnam. This is my third
                        semester at RMIT but it is my first semester as an IT student. In terms of languages, I can
                        speak English and I am in the process of learning French and obtaining the DELF B2. To be
                        honest, I am a low-tech person. My IT interest only started when I met my boyfriend whose major
                        is IoT. He has taught me some basic codes as well as inspired me to change my major to IT. I do
                        not have much experience in IT but during my semester gap, I have learned basic Python and some
                        Python packages such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib; HTML and CSS. Recently, I have made a
                        personal project related to data to enforce my knowledge. In my spare time, I enjoy watching
                        anime, especially the psychological ones that make me feel excited but also nervous such as Liar
                        Game, Tomodachi Game, and so on. I also love jogging, playing badminton, and hanging out with
                        friends.

                        Hi! My name is Lai Minh Tri, but if you have difficulties pronouncing it, you may call me Jay.
                        My student ID is s3927026, and you may reach me by email at laiminhtri@gmail.com. I was born and
                        raised in Ho Chi Minh City, and I've been living in my house in District 7 since 2017. Aside
                        from my native language, I am fluent in English and Japanese. In my spare time, I'd like to
                        spend time with my friends, particularly to play games or watch movies and spend quality time
                        together. My pastime has been travelling and playing basketball since I was a youngster, and it
                        would be good to have some pals to do it with. IT has such an impact on our everyday lives that
                        I remember watching a YouTube video when I was younger about a man attempting to automate every
                        fundamental task in his life. At the time, I had decided to pursue a career as an AI developer.
                        I attend this course with a learning attitude, I do not know much about IT but I have great
                        passion and interest about it.

                        Hello! My name is Luong Thao My, but I also go by the nickname “July”. My student ID is
                        s3922086. I come from the rolling green hills of Pleiku City, Gia Lai province and it’s my
                        second semester at RMIT. I used to study abroad in Texas, United States for four years
                        throughout high school before moving back to Vietnam. In my spare time, I enjoy listening to
                        podcasts, practising the piano, and singing. My interest in IT began in my 10th grade in High
                        School, where I first familiarised myself with Matlab. Though it was for a friend’s suggestion,
                        I began researching deeper in the field of programming and IT and began taking courses on
                        Coursera in my spare time. Although I initially pursued the Digital Marketing program in hope of
                        becoming a market analyst, I decided to switch to Information Technology as I began to realise
                        my passion for the technological aspects of the job. Some of my current IT experience are
                        Python, Java, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tableau. I’m currently working on gaining JavaScript and SQL
                        experience through Youtube, LinkedIn Learning and Coursera self-guided Projects.

                        Our group was not formed until the fourth week. In the beginning there was only Thu and My, then
                        came Vu, and eventually Tri joined the group. Despite our late introduction to each other, and
                        the fact that COVID-19 prevented any offline meeting until week 6, we were able to maintain a
                        cooperative and supportive atmosphere within the team. Throughout our second assignment, My has
                        become our de facto team leader, thanks largely to her dedication to the coursework and her
                        sociable nature which helps to bond the group together. For our third assignment, she had gone
                        out of her way to create a detailed task list to help everyone stay on track on what we needed
                        to do, recorded weekly meeting minutes, and set up weekly calls to review our progress. That is
                        not to say we did not encounter any hiccups. During the development of our demo, we ran into
                        some technical issues which forced us to rethink on how our demo should be like. Nevertheless,
                        we marched on, and thanks to Thu and Tri’s quick thinking, and coding skills, we were able to
                        whip up an alternative prototype just in time for our presentation.
