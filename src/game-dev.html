                        To accomplish the goal of creating a fully playable game, this project will require the
                        assistance of a game developer. We will be looking for someone with prior experience with
                        Gamemaker studio 2 and the Gamemaker language, as this is the game engine our team chose and has
                        been working with for several weeks, as well as strong communication and collaboration skills.
                        As an added benefit, given our inexperience with coding and game production, we may benefit from
                        the assistance of someone with extensive experience in the field to assist us in developing new
                        ideas and improving existing ones. Due to the complexity and significance of the game, this
                        position is critical to the project's success.
