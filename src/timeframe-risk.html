                        This is the first time our team attended an IT course in RMIT school, so everything is new to
                        us, we never experienced coding before nor making a game. We have been learning to do anything
                        from scratch, but there are a limited number of things we can learn in a short period of time
                        and after 3 months of studying in this course we cannot say that the project outcome of
                        assignment 3 is perfect but we surely can say that we are proud of it.

                        <h3 style="color: #E07A5F;"><b>Recruit a sufficient amount of participants for testing </b></h3>
                        Because of how much information this game needs to be completed, we know that finding enough
                        participants is really hard. We still try to overcome these problems by showing more people
                        about the game and also make it more practical, useful so that users who find the game
                        interesting will share it with others.

                        <h3 style="color: #E07A5F;"><b>Management of time </b></h3>
                        We know time is never enough so we always try our best to manage our time, make it as efficient
                        as possible. We want to cut down time for unnecessary parts and spend more time on some
                        essential sections of our game, so that the project outcome will be better.
                    </p>

                        <h3 style="color: #E07A5F;"><b>Interpersonal Conflict </b></h3>
                        Everyone has their own opinions and idea of how the project should be, because of this teamwork
                        will always have conflict. For our team, I can see that we know how to solve this problem by
                        listening to others and coming up with an ideal solution. If we can continue working like this
                        in the future, I believe that it will make our work easier.
