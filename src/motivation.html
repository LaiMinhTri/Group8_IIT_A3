                        For many Vietnamese high school students who are about to enter university, choosing a career
                        pathway is often seen as a gamble simply because they lack the necessary knowledge and
                        real-world resources to make an informed decision. There are several reasons for this, but most
                        can be boiled down to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vietnamese high school lacks adequate Academic and Career Guidance (ACGC) activities (Nguyen
                            2019). </li>
                        <li> Vietnamese parents’ influence on their children’s career choices that often clashed with
                            their own interests (Mai 2019)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        As a result, up to 50% of all students were found employed in totally different industries
                        unrelated to their chosen field after graduation (Ha 2020). Worse yet, Tran and Dang (2020)
                        found that in 2016, there were 225,000 Bachelor’s and Masters’ degree holders unemployed.
                        Needless to say, it is a waste of time and money for both parents, students, and the educational
                        institution involved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Elsewhere, the lack of proper ACGC activities also negatively impacted the overall productivity
                        of the Vietnamese labor force. Nguyen (2019, p. 28) also revealed that up to 80% of employers
                        who were hiring professionals and technicians reported that their applicants lacked the required
                        skill set including cognitive, social, and behavioral skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus, by working on this project, we are not only aiming to help future generations to be more
                        informed when it comes to their future career, but also to improve the Vietnamese labor force,
                        one player at a time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project would play right into the personalization trend that is happening in the tech
                        industry, as well as tap into Generation Z’s (GenZ) demand for more personalized content and
                        services (Jankowski 2020).
