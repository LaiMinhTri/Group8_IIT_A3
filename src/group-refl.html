                        For this course, our group members have a lot to learn from one another because this is our
                        first time working together. Even though everything went according to plan, there are still a
                        few things that could have been done more efficiently and effectively. As we have stressed
                        throughout the course, effective communication and collaboration are critical components of
                        successfully completing a task on time...

                        When I transferred to RMIT University from a private, well-known high school in Vietnam, I
                        immediately noticed how much the working style and assignment format resembled what I was used
                        to. As a result, I possess a number of distinct advantages that proved instrumental in
                        contributing to the team's work. Even though the team's communication was consistent and
                        efficient, as a patient listener, I noticed that it was not particularly productive. It was a
                        positive experience, especially during the decision-making phases, when everyone was mostly
                        compliant and in agreement with the possible options. As a result, I took the initiative to
                        conduct extensive research in order to gain additional technical expertise, which enabled me to
                        feel more confident and active during team discussions and selections. I discovered my potential
                        ability to focus on specific tasks unintentionally during my work with my teammates. I've always
                        suspected that my naturally bubbly and spontaneous personality interferes with my ability to
                        concentrate and divide my attention span, preventing me from fully committing to a task when
                        multiple tasks are required. However, when faced with three separate Intro courses' deadlines in
                        the same week, I was able to practice and hone my ability to maintain concentration. Rather than
                        discouraging me, the overwhelming amount of work instills in me a strong sense of motivation to
                        take the initiative and give my all.

                        In general, I believe that the group as a whole was extremely dedicated and committed to
                        bringing the somewhat implausible game concept to life. If I had to choose a single word to
                        describe our entire group work experience, it would be "Harmonious." Since the group's
                        inception, during the idea generation and research phase, our team has been extremely respectful
                        of one another's opinions and willing to expand our idea options. However, our mutual regard for
                        one another inevitably complicates decision-making. This occurs as a result of everyone's
                        compliant and general positivity with the proposed topics, not leaning toward any specific idea.
                        Thus, having an individual with strong preferences for a particular option was critical in order
                        to provide counter arguments for others and motivate the team to think more critically. With
                        regards to the project's concept, because our chosen subject denotes a fairly complex and
                        involved subject, our team has encountered several difficulties collaborating and resolving
                        inevitable problems. Choosing the most appropriate game engines proved to be one of the most
                        difficult aspects. Because the same situation of indecision could have occurred during this
                        phase, I proposed that the game development team (Thu, Tri, and me) each conduct independent
                        research on the various game engine options and be prepared to discuss several critical points,
                        such as whether we want to create an app or a web game, the advantages and disadvantages of each
                        popular and well-known game engine, and whether our game requires specific specialized features.
