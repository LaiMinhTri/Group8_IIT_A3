                        Among countless career exploration websites/platforms, two stood out the most and they are Claim
                        Your Future and Roadtrip Nation.

                        Claim Your Future (CYF) is an educational game that encourages students to explore career
                        pathways, financial decision making, and the future return on investment of post-secondary
                        education and training (Claim Your Future n.d.). According to its developer, the Finance
                        Authority of Maine, CYF began as a classroom game kit, but has since expanded into a digital
                        experience in response to changing trends in education such as remote learning.

                        Regarding the online version, after registration, the game presents the player with a few
                        preliminary questions to test his/her general knowledge, after which the player is greeted with
                        the main dashboard (See figure 2) where he/she can plan out his/her career path, budget, housing
                        option, and so on. Important information such as salary, student loans, and education are pulled
                        from the web (it should be noted that this information is catered to US audiences only).

                        At the core of Roadtrip Nation are videos of interviews with inspirational individuals who have
                        managed to carve out their own path in life with the main goal to open our eyes to what a
                        fulfilling career can truly be. The site also features a career exploration tool where students
                        and career seekers only need to answer three questions and the site will automatically pull
                        content e.g. interviews, jobs, leaders in that field for him/her to learn more about the role
                        (Figure 3)

                        What separates our project from CYF and Roadtrip Nation is the absence of value-added components
                        such as providing a budget estimation or introducing the players to successful people within
                        their chosen field to further inspire them.
